    "3. From these cards, assign a random deck of 5 cards to both the player and the computer (opponent). \n",
    "    3.1. This should happen whenever a new game begins\n",
    "4. Keep the game running for as long as there are cards in the player's deck or for as long as there are cards in the opponent's deck\n",

    "    4.2. Assign a random card to the opponent, and show that to the player, along with the details of that card. Only the details of this random card must be shown.\n",
    "    4.3. Ask the player to pick a card from their own deck to fight the opponent's card.\n",
    "    4.4. If the attack value of the player's card is more than the health of opponent's card, then the player wins this round.\n",
    "    4.5. Otherwise, the player's card will fight with the opponent's card. \n",
    "        4.5.1. Calculate the damage the player's card does to the opponent's card. This calculation should take care of the fact that the opponent's card will first defend the attack using its 'Defense' value.

    "        If the Wimp attacks Sorcerer, first, it will only affect Sorcerer's 'Defense' value. Sorcerer's defense value will decrease by the the attack value of player's Wimp card. Therefore, after the attack, the defense value will change from 55 to 15, as 55 - 40 = 15. Therefore, \n",

    "        Now, if in the next round, Wimp attacks Sorcerer again, then Sorcerer's defense value will decrease to 0, but its health will also be affected. The health will be affected by 25 points, as 40 - 15 = 25. So, Sorcerer's health will now decrease from 100 to 75\n",

    "        Now, let's say in a later round, the player uses the Marauder card, which has an attack value of 85, and the computer is using Sorcerer, whose health value is 75. \n",
    "\n",
    "        In that case, Sorcerer will be defeated, as 85 > 75. When this happens, remove the Sorcerer card from the deck of the opponent. \n",

    "        4.5.3. ONLY a card's 'Defense' and 'Health' value changes after an attack. And once the 'Health' value of a card reaches 0 or drops below it, that card MUST be removed from the deck.\n",
    "        4.5.4. After the player's turn, pause the second for some seconds, e.g., time.sleep(3) will pause the game for 3 seconds. \n",
    "    4.6. Display that now it's the opponent's turn. \n",
    "    4.7. Make sure there are cards available in opponent's deck. If there aren't, then the game ends and the player wins.\n",
    "    4.8. If there are still cards available in opponent's deck, draw a random card from the opponent's deck, and display its details to the player.\n",
    "    4.9. Then display the cards available in the player's deck. \n",
    "    4.10 Ask the user to pick one card from their own deck to fight the opponent's card. \n",
    "    4.11. REPEAT THE SAME LOGIC AS STATED FROM POINT 4.4 TO 4.5.3. But this time, from the perspective of the opponent.\n",
    "    4.12. After the opponent's turn is over, display that a new round will begin in some seconds.\n",
    "5. If it's found that the opponent has no card in their deck, then display a message stating player is the winner, otherwise display that the opponent won."
